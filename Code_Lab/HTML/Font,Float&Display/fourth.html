They may help boost the immune system, build strong bones and aid indigestion. Plus, despite their sweetness, pineapples are low in calories. Pineapples are members of the bromeliad family, and are the only bromeliad that produces edible fruit, according to the Purdue University Center for New Crops and Plant Products (opens in new tab). The fruit is made of many individual berries that grow together around a central core. Each pineapple scale is an individual flower, or berry.The nutritional benefits of pineapples are as attractive as their unique anatomy. "Pineapples contain high amounts of vitamin C and manganese," said San Diego-based nutritionist Laura Flores. These tropical fruits are also a good way to get important dietary fiber and bromelain (an enzyme).
